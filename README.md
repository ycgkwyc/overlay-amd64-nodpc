# overlay-amd64-nodpc

<br>

## Introduction
Same as Chromium OS, openFyde adopts the [Portage build and packaging system](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) from Gentoo Linux. openFyde uses Portage with certain customisations to support building multiple targets (bootable OS system images) across different hardware architectures from a shared set of sources.

A **board** defines a target type, it can be either for a family of hardware devices or specifically for one type of device. For example, The board `amd64-openfyde` is a target type for an openFyde system image that aims to run on most recent PCs with amd64(x86_64) architecture; whilst the `rpi4-openfyde` board is a target type specifically for the infamous single-board computer [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). We usually append `-openfyde` to the board name in openFyde to differentiate between its siblings for FydeOS. 

Each board has a corresponding **overlay** that defines the configuration for it. This includes details like CPU architecture, kernel configuration, as well as additional packages and USE flags.

## About the board `amd64-nodpc`
This board targets a generically bootable openFyde image on most Intel-powered x86_64 PC devices, specifically, the device should have:
 - Intel CPUs released on or after the year 2011, specifically, Intel 2nd generation Coreâ„¢ Processors ["Sandy Bridge"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)) and later
 - Intel Atom, Celeron and Pentium processors released on or after the year 2013, specifically, Intel Atom SoC ["Bay Trail"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(system_on_a_chip)) or later
 - Integrated Intel HD graphics

 `amd64-openfyde` is the foundation for [FydeOS for PC](https://fydeos.io/download/pc/intel-hd) release.
